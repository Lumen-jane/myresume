            <p><p>As a passionate and dedicated DevOps Engineer, I am eager to apply my knowledge at any given opportunity. I have a solid foundation in automation, containerization, 
                and cloud technologies. I'm currently working in a start-up company but I love challenging myself and taking up tasks that will brush me up and make me outstanding. I have also completed various projects during my HNG internship, 
                I am actively seeking for opportunities where I can contribute to the efficiency and reliability of IT infrastructure, gain more experience,
                 and further develop my expertise in DevOps and cloud engineering.
